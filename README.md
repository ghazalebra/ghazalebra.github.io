## Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant at VisionIC lab / CHU Sainte-Justine (2021-2023)**
- I developed an AI-powered toolbox for automatic and markerless 3D motion tracking and analysis in scoliosis patients. This work is the first step toward automatic dynamic analysis of trunk motion in 3D. The toolbox takes a sequence of 3D point clouds of the back surface throughout a movement, locates specific landmarks in each frame, extracts and visualizes the trajectories in 3D, calculates trunk motion metrics based on the detected landmarks, and creates analysis graphs.

**Undergraduate research assistant at IPL (Sharif University)**
- I worked on improving the robustness of the self-distillation network against adversarial attacks.
