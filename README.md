## Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant at VisionIC lab / CHU Sainte-Justine (2021-2023)**
- Collected a dataset consisting of dynamic 3D acquisitions of movements performed by 24 patients with scoliosis
- Trained a computer vision model to track the 3D motion of anatomical landmarks on the human back surface through subtle movements in patients with scoliosis
- Achieved a high correlation (statistically significant) between motion analysis based on the model's results and the groundtruth

**Undergraduate research assistant at IPL (Sharif University)**
- Improved the adversarial robustness of the self-distillation network for classification on CIFAR10
